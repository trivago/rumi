# rumi executor for POSIX and compliant systems.

# NOTE: The additional forward slashes in front of each path are required
# for cygwin based shell emulators on Windows, because they otherwise
# simply transform the paths to Windows paths. This behavior is usually
# exactly what is desired but not in this case since docker is Linux
# based and cannot handle Windows paths. Note further that POSIX compliant
# systems have to replace three or more leading slashes with a single
# slash (see POSIX 1003.1).
